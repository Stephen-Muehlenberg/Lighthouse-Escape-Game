# Lighthouse Escape Game
An online co-op escape room demo, intended to be a free, open source framework for similar games.

## About

This project is developed in [**Unity 2020.3.8f1**](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.8). It uses the open source [**Mirror Networking**](https://mirror-networking.com/) framework to handle network connection, [**Steamworks**](https://partner.steamgames.com/) to allow you to invite friends, and [**FizzySteamworks**](https://github.com/Chykary/FizzySteamworks) as the network transport between them.

## Build

Latest Windows build can be found [here](https://github.com/Stephen-Muehlenberg/Lighthouse-Escape-Game/blob/master/Latest%20Build/Lighthouse%20Escape%20Room%20v0.2.0.7z). **Requires a Steam account for network functionality.**

This build allows you to create a game and invite a friend through Steam. With the game, you can see each other moving around, and can trigger basic switches. No significant gameplay content has been added yet.
